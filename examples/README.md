# vert.x clojure examples

My first step here will be to port the existing examples to clojure
using the java interop layer.  As I go, I'll slowly introduce abstractions
that look interesting and see where things go

to test, add clojure JAR to APP_HOME/lib
(for dev, that's build/vert.x-1.2.3.final/lib)
